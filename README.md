# Simon Game
Work in progress for freeCodeCamp's final front end development project.

Live Demo: coming soon

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Features:
* User is presented with a random series of button presses
* Each time the user answers correctly, they see the same series of button presses with an additional step
* Sound plays on every button press
* Counter shows the current round

Need to Implement:
* If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
* If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
* I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
* I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
